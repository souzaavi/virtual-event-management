For Sending Emails, you need to create a .env file in the root directory and add the following code:
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your-app-password>
EMAIL_USER=<your-email>
```

For the email to work properly, you need to allow less secure apps to access your email account. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings and enabling the option "Allow less secure apps". And also you need to create an app password for your email account. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings and enabling the option "Create an app password". After that, you need to copy the generated password and paste it in the .env file.
